## 🧠 **Human Audience Requirements Analysis**

### Cognitive Architecture for Documentation

**Human Information Processing Patterns:**

- **Scanning Behavior:** Users scan headings and structure before reading content
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Preference for overview-to-detail information architecture
- **Spatial Memory:** Navigation patterns rely on spatial and hierarchical memory
- **Cognitive Load Management:** Consistent patterns reduce mental effort required for navigation

**Documentation Usability Principles:**

- **Predictable Structure:** Consistent organization reduces learning curve for new documents
- **Meaningful Headings:** Descriptive section titles enable effective scanning and navigation
- **Logical Hierarchy:** Information architecture follows user mental models and task flows
- **Cross-Reference Support:** Related information linked clearly for workflow continuity

### Human Navigation Preferences

**Hierarchical Navigation Patterns:**

```markdown
# Human-Preferred Information Architecture
Project Overview (high-level context)
├── Getting Started (immediate action)
├── Core Concepts (foundational understanding)
├── Implementation Details (practical application)
├── Advanced Topics (expert-level information)
└── Reference Materials (lookup information)
```

**Information Seeking Behaviors:**

- **Goal-Oriented Search:** Users approach documentation with specific tasks or questions
- **Context-Dependent Navigation:** Information needs vary based on user role and experience level
- **Progressive Learning:** Users build understanding incrementally through repeated interactions
- **Error Recovery:** Navigation patterns must support backtracking and alternative pathways

├── 2. Dependencies (prerequisites and relationships)
├── 3. Structure (organization and navigation)
├── 4. Implementation (practical application)
├── 5. Security & Compliance (universal anchor)
└── 6. Support (help and maintenance)
```

**Retrieval Accuracy Factors:**
