﻿# Security Policy

## Our Commitment to Security

The RAG-Optimized Documentation Framework is designed with security and transparency as core principles. This document outlines our security practices, reporting procedures, and guidelines for secure implementation of the framework.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          | Status |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------ |
| 1.0.x   | ✅ Yes            | Current stable release |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No             | Pre-release development versions |

## Security Model

### Framework Security Principles

**Transparency by Design:**

- All framework components are open-source and publicly auditable
- No hidden dependencies or closed-source components
- Clear attribution and provenance for all framework elements

**Minimal Attack Surface:**

- Framework operates on static documentation files only
- No database dependencies or external service requirements
- No user authentication or session management components

**Git-Native Security:**

- Version control provides complete audit trail of all changes
- Cryptographic commit signing supported for enhanced integrity
- Distributed architecture eliminates single points of failure

### Data Security Considerations

**No Sensitive Data Collection:**

- Framework does not collect, store, or transmit personal information
- Documentation templates do not require sensitive data input
- Repository structure designed for public transparency

**Content Security:**

- Framework provides patterns for secure documentation practices
- Guidelines for handling sensitive information in documentation
- Recommendations for public/private content separation

## Security Best Practices for Implementation

### Repository Security

**Access Control:**

- Configure appropriate repository permissions for your organization
- Use branch protection rules for production documentation
- Implement required reviews for sensitive documentation changes
- Consider signed commits for enhanced authenticity

**Content Management:**

- Separate public framework adoption from private organizational content
- Use `.gitignore` patterns to prevent accidental sensitive data inclusion
- Implement content review processes for public documentation
- Consider private forks for organizational adaptation

### Automation Security

**Script Execution:**

- Review all PowerShell scripts before execution in your environment
- Use `-DryRun` flag to preview changes before implementation
- Validate script integrity through checksums or signing
- Run scripts with minimal required permissions

**CI/CD Security:**

- Secure GitHub Actions workflows with appropriate permissions
- Use environment secrets for any required credentials
- Implement security scanning in automated workflows
- Regularly update action dependencies

### AI Integration Security

**RAG System Security:**

- Validate documentation content before AI ingestion
- Implement access controls on knowledge bases
- Monitor AI system access to documentation repositories
- Consider privacy implications of AI-generated content

**Content Validation:**

- Verify accuracy of AI-assisted documentation generation
- Implement human review for AI-generated content
- Maintain clear attribution for AI-assisted work
- Document AI tool usage for transparency

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities through our established reporting channels.

**For Public Vulnerabilities** (affecting the open-source framework):

- Report through [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/vintagedon/rag-optimized-documentation/security/advisories)
- Use our [vulnerability report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/security-vulnerability.md)
- Include detailed reproduction steps and impact assessment

**For Private/Sensitive Reports:**

- Email: <security@vintagedon.dev>
- Subject: "RAG-Docs Security Report - [Brief Description]"
- Include: Detailed description, impact assessment, suggested remediation

### What to Include in Reports

**Required Information:**

- Clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact and severity assessment
- Suggested remediation approach (if known)

**Additional Helpful Information:**

- Environment details (OS, PowerShell version, etc.)
- Screenshots or logs demonstrating the issue
- References to similar vulnerabilities or security research
- Proof-of-concept code (if applicable and safe to share)

### Response Timeline

**Initial Response:** Within 48 hours of report receipt
**Assessment:** Complete security assessment within 5 business days
**Resolution:** Security fixes prioritized based on severity assessment
**Disclosure:** Coordinated disclosure timeline established with reporter

## Security Update Process

### Vulnerability Assessment

**Severity Classification:**

- **Critical**: Immediate threat to data integrity or system security
- **High**: Significant security risk requiring prompt attention
- **Medium**: Moderate security concern with workaround available
- **Low**: Minor security improvement or hardening opportunity

**Impact Evaluation:**

- Framework components affected
- User impact and mitigation requirements
- Backward compatibility considerations
- Documentation and communication needs

### Update Distribution

**Security Releases:**

- Tagged releases for all security updates
- Clear security advisory with impact description
- Migration guide for affected implementations
- Automated notification through GitHub watch features

**Communication Channels:**

- [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/vintagedon/rag-optimized-documentation/security/advisories)
- [Release Notes](https://github.com/vintagedon/rag-optimized-documentation/releases)
- [Community Discussions](https://github.com/vintagedon/rag-optimized-documentation/discussions)
- Project documentation updates

## Security Hardening Guidelines

### Repository Configuration

**Branch Protection:**

```yaml
# Recommended branch protection settings
required_status_checks:
  strict: true
  contexts: ["security-scan", "documentation-validation"]
enforce_admins: true
required_pull_request_reviews:
  required_approving_review_count: 2
  dismiss_stale_reviews: true
  require_code_owner_reviews: true
```

**Security Scanning:**

- Enable Dependabot alerts and security updates
- Configure CodeQL analysis for supported file types
- Implement secret scanning to prevent credential exposure
- Use third-party security scanning tools for comprehensive coverage

### Implementation Security

**Documentation Content:**

- Implement content review processes for public documentation
- Use placeholder values in examples and templates
- Separate configuration examples from actual credentials
- Document security considerations for AI system integration

**Script Security:**

- Code sign PowerShell scripts for production use
- Implement input validation and sanitization
- Use PowerShell execution policies appropriately
- Regular security review of automation components

## Compliance and Standards

### Industry Standards

**Documentation Security:**

- Align with ISO 27001 information security management principles
- Follow NIST Cybersecurity Framework guidelines
- Implement GDPR-compliant data handling practices
- Consider SOC 2 requirements for organizational implementations

**Development Security:**

- Follow OWASP secure coding practices
- Implement secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC)
- Use automated security testing in CI/CD pipelines
- Regular dependency vulnerability assessment

### Audit Support

**Compliance Documentation:**

- Complete audit trail through Git version control
- Systematic documentation of security decisions and implementations
- Clear attribution and approval workflows
- Regular security assessment and improvement documentation

**Third-Party Assessment:**

- Framework design supports external security review
- Open-source transparency enables community security validation
- Professional security assessment welcome and encouraged
