## **Dependencies & Relationships**

### Framework Components

- [Standards Specification](standards-specification.md) - Technical requirements and patterns
- [Getting Started Guide](getting-started.md) - Initial implementation pathway

### Implementation Support

- [Template Library](../templates/README.md) - Standardized implementation patterns
- [Migration Guide](migration-guide.md) - Transition strategies from existing systems

---

## **Structural Implementation Practices**

### Hierarchical README Architecture

**Start Small, Scale Systematically:**
Begin with a single directory level and expand hierarchically as project complexity grows. Avoid over-architecting initial implementations.

**One README Per Directory Rule:**
Every directory containing files must have a README.md that serves as both content overview and navigation hub.

**Navigation Link Discipline:**

- Link to ALL files in current directory with descriptions
- Link ONLY to immediate subdirectory READMEs
- Provide upward navigation to parent directory
- Include cross-references to related directories at same level

**Example Navigation Pattern:**

```markdown
### File Inventory
- **script.sh** - Main automation script with error handling
- **config.yml** - Configuration parameters and defaults

### Subdirectories
- **[tests](tests/README.md)** - Test suites and validation scripts
- **[docs](docs/README.md)** - Additional documentation

### Related Components
- **[../monitoring](../monitoring/README.md)** - System monitoring tools
```

### Semantic Section Numbering Excellence

**Section 5 Consistency:**
Always implement Section 5 as "Security & Compliance" across ALL documentation types. This provides reliable semantic anchors for AI retrieval systems.

**Numbering Adaptation by Document Type:**

- **Primary README:** 1-Introduction, 2-Dependencies, 3-Repository Structure, 4-Usage, 5-Security & Compliance, 6-Community & Support
- **Interior README:** 1-Introduction, 2-Dependencies, 3-Directory Structure, 4-Usage & Implementation, 5-Security & Compliance, 6-Maintenance & Support

**Semantic Consistency Rule:**
Same section numbers must always address the same conceptual topics across all documents in a repository.

---

## **Content Quality Practices**

### YAML Front Matter Standards

**Complete Metadata Implementation:**

```yaml
---
title: "[Clear, descriptive title with context]"
description: "One-sentence actionable summary"
author: "VintageDon - https://github.com/vintagedon"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
version: "X.Y"
status: "[Draft/In-Review/Published/Archived]"
tags:
- type: [document-classification]
- domain: [business/technical-domain]
- tech: [technologies-involved]
- audience: [primary-target-users]
related_documents:
- "[Document Title](path/to/document.md)"
---
```

**Tagging Discipline:**

- Use lowercase with hyphens for multi-word tags
- Maximum 8 tags total across all categories
- Maintain consistency across related documents
- Be specific rather than generic

### Content Writing Excellence

**KISS Principle Application:**

- Write for clarity and scanability
- Use active voice and concrete examples
- Avoid unnecessary complexity or jargon
- Include specific, actionable information

**Dual-Audience Optimization:**

- Structure content for human scanability with clear headings
- Ensure semantic coherence within each numbered section
- Avoid arbitrary content breaks that fragment meaning
- Use consistent terminology throughout documentation

---

## **Implementation Workflow Practices**

### Git-Native Development

**Documentation-as-Code Integration:**

- Treat documentation changes as code changes requiring review
- Use feature branches for significant documentation updates
- Include documentation updates in same commits as related code changes
- Maintain documentation in same repository as code it describes

**Atomic Commit Strategy:**

```bash
# Good: Atomic documentation commits
git commit -m "docs: Add security guidelines to monitoring README"
git commit -m "feat: Update API documentation for new endpoint"

# Avoid: Mixed concerns in single commit
git commit -m "Add feature X and update various docs"
```

### Review and Validation

**Pre-Commit Validation:**

- Validate YAML front matter syntax
- Check internal link functionality
- Verify semantic section numbering compliance
- Confirm template adherence

**Peer Review Focus Areas:**

- Technical accuracy and completeness
- Framework compliance verification
- Content clarity and actionability
- Navigation link accuracy

---

## **Maintenance Strategy Practices**

### Systematic Update Processes

**Regular Maintenance Schedule:**

- **Monthly:** Link validation and accuracy checks
- **Quarterly:** Content freshness and relevance review
- **Release-based:** Version numbers and change logs update
- **Annual:** Comprehensive framework compliance audit

**Update Trigger Identification:**

- New features or functionality added
- External dependencies change
- Community feedback indicates issues
- Framework standards updates

### Automation Integration

**GitHub Actions Implementation:**

```yaml
# Essential automation for framework compliance
name: Documentation Validation
on:
  pull_request:
    paths: ['**/*.md']
jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Validate YAML front matter
      - name: Check semantic numbering
      - name: Validate markdown links
```

**Quality Gates:**

- Automated YAML front matter validation
- Link checking on every pull request
- Semantic numbering compliance verification
- Template structure validation

---

## **Team Collaboration Practices**

### Contributor Onboarding

**Framework Education:**

- Provide clear template examples for all document types
- Document semantic numbering rationale and benefits
- Explain dual-audience optimization principles
- Share successful implementation examples

**Contribution Guidelines:**

- Include framework-specific requirements in CONTRIBUTING.md
- Provide pre-filled templates for common document types
- Establish clear review criteria and processes
- Recognize quality contributions to encourage adoption

### Knowledge Transfer

**Documentation Handoffs:**

- Include framework compliance checklist in handoff process
- Verify new team member understanding of semantic numbering
- Ensure template library familiarity
- Document domain-specific adaptation patterns

---

## **Security & Compliance**

### Documentation Security

**Security Considerations:**

- Never include sensitive information in documentation examples
- Review all code examples for potential security implications
- Use placeholder values for configuration examples
- Consider privacy implications of detailed system documentation

### Framework Compliance

**Standards Adherence:**

- Follow accessibility guidelines for inclusive documentation
- Maintain proper attribution for external content sources
- Ensure license compatibility with framework requirements
- Implement version control best practices for audit trails

### Quality Assurance

**Validation Standards:**

- Implement automated compliance checking where possible
- Establish peer review requirements for documentation changes
- Maintain testing procedures for framework adherence
- Document exception handling for special cases

## **Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid**

### Structural Anti-Patterns

**Navigation Violations:**

- Linking beyond immediate child directories
- Missing upward navigation to parent directories
- Broken or outdated internal links
- Inconsistent navigation patterns across similar documents

**Semantic Numbering Violations:**

- Using Section 5 for non-security content
- Inconsistent section numbering across related documents
- Arbitrary section breaks that fragment semantic meaning
- Missing required sections in template implementations

### Content Anti-Patterns

**Metadata Neglect:**

- Incomplete or missing YAML front matter
- Inconsistent tagging across related documents
- Outdated version numbers or modification dates
- Missing or incorrect relationship documentation

**Documentation Debt:**

- Allowing outdated information to persist
- Creating documentation without clear ownership
- Implementing framework partially without completion plan
- Ignoring link rot and structural degradation
