- Ensure proper directory structure and file naming conventions

**2. YAML Front Matter Validation**

- Verify required metadata fields are present and properly formatted
- Validate tag taxonomy and categorization consistency
- Check date formatting and version numbering standards
- Ensure related documents links are valid and properly formatted

**3. Content Quality Checks**

- Verify markdown syntax and formatting standards
- Check for broken internal links and missing file references
- Validate cross-reference consistency between related documents
- Ensure code blocks include language specifications where applicable

**4. Template Compliance**

- Verify new documentation follows appropriate template structure
- Check for placeholder content that should be customized
- Validate that required sections are present and properly populated
- Ensure metadata completeness for different document types

**Workflow Configuration:**

```yaml
name: Documentation Validation

  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '**/*.md'
      - '**/*.yml'
      - '**/*.yaml'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  validate-documentation:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      
      - name: Install validation tools

          scripts/validate-structure.sh
      
      - name: Generate validation report
        run: |
          scripts/generate-validation-report.sh > validation-report.md
      
      - name: Comment validation results
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            const fs = require('fs');
            const report = fs.readFileSync('validation-report.md', 'utf8');
            github.rest.issues.createComment({
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              body: report
            });
```

### Link Validation Workflow
