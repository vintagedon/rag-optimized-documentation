### Scope

**What's Covered:**

- Exemplary framework implementations
- Best practice demonstrations
- Domain-specific adaptation patterns

**What's Not Covered:**

- Incomplete or experimental implementations
- Projects without clear documentation quality metrics
- Non-public repositories

### Target Audience

**Primary Users:** Teams implementing the framework  
**Secondary Users:** Framework contributors seeking reference patterns  
**Background Assumed:** Basic understanding of documentation frameworks and Git workflows

### Overview

Featured projects are selected based on implementation quality, documentation completeness, and demonstration of framework principles.
