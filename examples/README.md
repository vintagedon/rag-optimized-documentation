## 🚀 **Usage & Implementation**

Guidelines for using examples to implement the RAG-optimized documentation framework.

### Selecting Appropriate Examples

**Enterprise Projects:**

- Organizations with formal governance and compliance requirements
- Large teams requiring structured collaboration and quality assurance
- Complex projects needing comprehensive audit trails and documentation
- Integration with existing enterprise tools and processes

**Small Projects:**

- Teams seeking immediate value with minimal setup overhead
- Projects with straightforward documentation needs
- Organizations beginning framework adoption and evaluation
- Rapid prototyping and proof-of-concept implementations

**TRACE Methodology:**

- Teams implementing human-AI collaboration workflows
- Projects requiring detailed audit trails and decision documentation
- Organizations focusing on knowledge capture and learning
- Compliance-driven environments needing transparent AI usage

### Implementation Approach

**Phase 1: Assessment and Selection**

- Review examples to identify best fit for organizational context
- Assess current documentation maturity and improvement opportunities
- Determine governance and compliance requirements
- Plan phased adoption approach and success metrics

**Phase 2: Customization and Adaptation**

- Adapt selected examples to organizational standards and requirements
- Customize templates and structures for specific project needs
- Integrate with existing tools, processes, and workflows
- Establish quality assurance and maintenance procedures

**Phase 3: Implementation and Refinement**

- Begin with pilot projects using selected examples as foundation
- Gather feedback and refine implementation based on experience
- Scale successful patterns across additional projects and teams
- Contribute improvements and lessons learned back to community

### Best Practices for Example Usage
