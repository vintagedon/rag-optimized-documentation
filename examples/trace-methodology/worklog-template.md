# **TRACE Methodology Work Log Template**

Structured template for maintaining transparent project development logs using the TRACE methodology framework.

---

## 📖 **Introduction**

This template provides a systematic approach to documenting project development progress using the TRACE (Transparent, Reproducible, Audited Co-creation Engine) methodology. It ensures transparent tracking of development decisions, methodology application, and project evolution.

### Purpose

Enable systematic documentation of project development progress, TRACE methodology application, and decision-making rationale for transparency and reproducibility.

### Scope

**What's Covered:**

- TRACE methodology cycle documentation and tracking
- Development decision rationale and context capture
- Progress tracking with business outcome alignment
- Methodology effectiveness assessment during development

**What's Not Covered:**

- Detailed technical implementation documentation (separate technical docs)
- Code-level changes and version control (Git commit messages)
- Meeting minutes and administrative coordination (separate project management)

### Target Audience

**Primary Users:** Project contributors and team members applying TRACE methodology  
**Secondary Users:** Project stakeholders reviewing development progress  
**Background Assumed:** Understanding of TRACE methodology phases and project objectives

### Overview

Template supports systematic documentation of TRACE methodology application throughout project development lifecycle with focus on transparency and continuous improvement.
