# **Project File Structure**

A comprehensive guide to the organization and navigation of the TRACE v2 Spec-AI small project demonstration, designed for efficient knowledge discovery and RAG optimization.

---

## **Introduction**

This document provides a complete map of the small project documentation structure, explaining the purpose and relationships between all files. The organization follows RAG-optimized documentation principles with hierarchical README architecture and semantic cross-referencing to support both human navigation and AI knowledge retrieval.

### **Design Principles**

**Hierarchical Organization:** Each directory contains a README that serves as both content and navigation hub
**Semantic Sectioning:** Consistent section numbering for reliable AI knowledge retrieval
**Cross-Reference Integrity:** Bidirectional links maintain navigation coherence
**Purpose-Driven Structure:** Each file has a specific role in demonstrating the methodology
