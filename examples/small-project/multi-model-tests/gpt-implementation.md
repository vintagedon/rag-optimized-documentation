# **GPT-4o Implementation**

Documentation of GPT's implementation of the approved TRACE v2 Spec-AI specification, highlighting the comprehensive approach that includes complete test automation and workflow understanding.

---

## **Introduction**

This document captures GPT-4o's implementation of the Docker Flask application using the identical specification validated in Cycle 1. GPT's approach demonstrates exceptional understanding of the complete engineering workflow by including not only the required implementation artifacts but also the full test automation framework.

### **Implementation Context**

**Model:** GPT-4o (OpenAI)  
**Test Date:** 2025-01-19 10:15-10:17 AM  
**Specification Input:** Identical to approved Cycle 1 specification  
**Generation Approach:** Single-shot implementation with comprehensive workflow understanding

### **GPT's Response Excellence**

GPT distinguished itself by providing not just the requested artifacts but the complete acceptance test script from the specification, demonstrating superior understanding of the entire engineering task and workflow requirements.

---

## **Generated Implementation Artifacts**

### **Flask Application (app.py)**

```python
from flask import Flask, Response

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.get("/")
def root():
    # Must return exactly: Hello World!
    return "Hello World!"

@app.get("/healthz")
def healthz():
    # Must return HTTP 200 with body exactly: {"status":"ok"}
    return Response('{"status":"ok"}', status=200, mimetype="application/json")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Bind 0.0.0.0 on port 5000 per spec
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)
```

### **Dependencies (requirements.txt)**

```python
flask==3.0.3
```

### **Container Specification (Dockerfile)**

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app

# Copy and install pinned deps
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy app
COPY app.py .

EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### **Included Test Automation (Optional Addition)**

GPT uniquely provided the complete test script matching the specification:

```bash
docker build -t flask-hello .
docker run --rm -d -p 5000:5000 --name hello flask-hello

# readiness loop (<=15s)
for i in $(seq 1 30); do
  code=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://127.0.0.1:5000/healthz || true)
  [ "$code" = "200" ] && break
  sleep 0.5
done
[ "$code" = "200" ]

# verify endpoints
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:5000/                  # expect: Hello World!
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:5000/healthz           # expect: {"status":"ok"}

docker stop hello
```

---

## **Test Execution Results**

### **Complete Test Validation**

**Test Environment:** macOS Docker Desktop  
**Execution Time:** 2.2 minutes total SME oversight  
**Overall Result:** ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED

| Test Step | Command | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|-----------|---------|----------------|---------------|--------|
| Build Image | `docker build -t flask-hello .` | Exit code 0 | ✅ Success (2.1s) | PASS |
| Run Container | `docker run --rm -d -p 5000:5000 --name hello flask-hello` | Exit code 0 | ✅ Container ID returned | PASS |
| Check Readiness | Health endpoint polling loop | HTTP 200 within 15s | ✅ Ready after 1.2s | PASS |
| Verify Root | `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:5000/` | "Hello World!" | ✅ Exact match | PASS |
| Verify Health | `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:5000/healthz` | {"status":"ok"} | ✅ Exact match | PASS |
| Stop Container | `docker stop hello` | Exit code 0 | ✅ Clean shutdown | PASS |

**Success Rate:** 100% (6/6 tests passed)  
**First-Generation Success:** ✅ No iteration required  
**Specification Compliance:** All requirements met with best practices
