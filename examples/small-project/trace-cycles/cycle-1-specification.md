# **Cycle 1: Specification and Verification (R-A-V1)**

Documentation of the first TRACE v2 Spec-AI cycle focusing on outcome definition and success criteria validation through collaborative specification development.

---

## **Introduction**

This document captures the complete R-A-V1 (Request-Analyze-Verify) process that established the specification and test plan for the Docker Flask application. This cycle demonstrates the core innovation of TRACE v2 Spec-AI: shifting SME cognitive load from implementation review to outcome validation.

### **Cycle Objectives**

**Primary Goal:** Develop a complete, unambiguous specification defining success for a containerized Python Flask application
**Secondary Goal:** Create objective test criteria that provide binary validation of specification compliance
**Success Metric:** SME approval of specification and test plan within 5 minutes

### **Participants**

**Subject Matter Expert (SME):** Domain expert with containerization and web application requirements
**AI Partner:** Claude Sonnet 4 serving as specification development assistant
**Duration:** 5 minutes of active SME time

---

## **Stage 1: Request (R) - Outcome-Focused Directive**

### **SME's Strategic Intent**

The SME began with a clear outcome vision rather than implementation prescription:

> "I need to demonstrate TRACE v2 Spec-AI methodology using a simple, testable example. The goal is to create a containerized web application that clearly shows how specification-driven collaboration works."

### **Actual Request Prompt**

**Time:** 09:00 AM  
**Duration:** 1 minute formulation time

```markdown
You are a technical implementation specialist helping me create a Docker Flask application example. 

I need a spec for a basic Python web app in a Docker container. The main goal is to have something simple and runnable that we can use as a clear example for demonstrating TRACE v2 Spec-AI methodology.

It should have a 'Hello World' endpoint and a health check so we know it's up. I need to be able to build it and test it easily from the command line.

Your task is to first propose a complete specification for the final Docker image and a test plan with shell commands to verify that the image builds and runs correctly. 

Do not generate the Dockerfile yet - focus on defining what success looks like.
```

### **Request Analysis**

**Key Elements:**

- **Outcome Definition:** "Simple and runnable" with specific endpoints
- **Context Provision:** TRACE v2 methodology demonstration purpose  
- **Explicit Instruction:** Request specification and test plan, not implementation
- **Success Criteria:** "Easily testable from command line"
- **Scope Boundary:** Clear instruction not to implement yet

**TRACE v2 Innovation:** Rather than asking "build me an app," the request asks "define what success looks like."

---

## **Stage 2: Analyze (A) - AI Specification Development**

### **AI Processing and Response**

**Time:** 09:01 AM  
**Duration:** 45 seconds generation time

```markdown
I'll create a comprehensive specification for your Docker Flask application that defines clear success criteria and testing methodology.

## Proposed Specification: Dockerized Flask Hello World

### Objective
Build a Docker image and run a container that exposes two endpoints:
- `GET /` → returns HTTP 200 with body exactly: `Hello World!`
- `GET /healthz` → returns HTTP 200 with body exactly: `{"status":"ok"}`

### Constraints
- **Language:** Python 3.11
- **Base Image:** `python:3.11-slim`
- **Dependencies:** `flask==3.0.3`
- **Application Binding:** Must bind to `0.0.0.0` on port 5000
- **File Manifest:** No extra services or files beyond `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `Dockerfile`

### Test Plan
I propose these acceptance tests that must all pass:

1. **Build Image:**
   - Command: `docker build -t flask-hello .`
   - Expect: Command completes with exit code 0

2. **Run Container:**
   - Command: `docker run --rm -d -p 5000:5000 --name hello flask-hello`
   - Expect: Command completes with exit code 0

3. **Check Readiness:**
   - Logic: Poll `http://127.0.0.1:5000/healthz` every 0.5 seconds until HTTP 200
   - Expect: Ready within 15 seconds (30 attempts max)

4. **Verify Root Endpoint:**
   - Command: `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
   - Expect: Output exactly matches `Hello World!`

5. **Verify Health Endpoint:**
   - Command: `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:5000/healthz`  
   - Expect: Output exactly matches `{"status":"ok"}`

6. **Stop Container:**
   - Command: `docker stop hello`
   - Expect: Command completes with exit code 0

### Questions for Clarification
- Should I add any specific HTTP response headers?
- Are there any performance requirements (startup time, response time)?
- Do you want any logging or debugging output during tests?
```

### **Analysis Quality Assessment**

**Specification Completeness:**

- ✅ Clear objective with exact endpoint behaviors
- ✅ Precise constraints eliminating ambiguity
- ✅ Complete file manifest preventing scope creep
- ✅ Version pinning for reproducible builds

**Test Plan Quality:**

- ✅ Binary pass/fail criteria for each test
- ✅ Complete build → run → validate → cleanup sequence
- ✅ Race condition handling with readiness check
- ✅ Exact output validation eliminating interpretation

**Innovation Demonstration:**

- ✅ AI focused on defining success, not implementation approach
- ✅ Test plan provides objective validation method
- ✅ Specification eliminates need for implementation review

---

## **Stage 3: Verify (V1) - SME Outcome Validation**

### **SME Review Process**

**Time:** 09:02 AM  
**Duration:** 4 minutes review and decision time

The SME applied the TRACE v2 Spec-AI verification framework:

#### **Verification Questions Applied**

**1. Completeness Check**
"Does this specification fully define the desired outcome?"

- ✅ All endpoints specified with exact responses
- ✅ Container behavior completely defined
- ✅ Build and deployment process covered
- ✅ Test validation comprehensive

**2. Accuracy Assessment**
"Do these success criteria align with my actual goals?"

- ✅ Simple demonstration example as requested
- ✅ Easily testable from command line
- ✅ Clear success/failure determination
- ✅ Appropriate complexity for methodology demonstration

**3. Testability Evaluation**
"Will passing these tests prove the objective is met?"

- ✅ Every requirement has corresponding test
- ✅ Tests provide binary pass/fail results
- ✅ Race conditions handled appropriately
- ✅ Complete lifecycle validation included

**4. Feasibility Review**
"Are these requirements realistic and achievable?"

- ✅ Standard Docker and Flask patterns
- ✅ Reasonable resource requirements
- ✅ Clear technical approach
- ✅ No unusual or risky dependencies

#### **Minor Clarification Required**

**SME Feedback:**
"The specification looks comprehensive. I have one clarification: the test plan mentions polling for 15 seconds but shows 30 attempts at 0.5 second intervals. That's actually 15 seconds total, which is correct. Just wanted to confirm the math is intentional."

**AI Clarification:**
"Correct - 30 attempts × 0.5 seconds = 15 seconds maximum wait time. This provides reasonable startup time while preventing indefinite waiting."

**SME Validation:** "Perfect. That addresses the only potential ambiguity."

### **Final Verification Decision**

**Time:** 09:06 AM  
**SME Decision:** **APPROVED**

**Verification Statement:**

```markdown
"This specification completely defines what success looks like for our demonstration. 
If an implementation meets this spec and passes all these tests, our goal will be achieved. 
The tests are comprehensive, binary, and will provide objective validation. 

V1 is approved. Proceed to implementation generation."
```

### **Cognitive Load Analysis**

**SME Mental Process:**

- **Strategic Focus:** Evaluated outcome definition against goals
- **Domain Expertise:** Applied knowledge of container and web application requirements
- **Quality Standards:** Validated test adequacy for proving success
- **Decision Simplicity:** Binary approve/reject based on success definition

**Time Distribution:**

- Reading specification: 2 minutes
- Evaluating test plan: 1.5 minutes
- Clarification discussion: 30 seconds

**Cognitive Effort:** Low to moderate - focused on familiar domain validation rather than technical implementation prediction
