# 🎯 **Cognitive Specialization Prompts**

Copy-paste ready prompt templates that leverage each AI model's unique cognitive strengths for systematic multi-perspective project assessment.

---

## **📖 Introduction**

This document provides tested prompt templates that extract specialized cognitive perspectives from different AI models. Each prompt is designed to leverage specific model strengths while maintaining consistency in output format for cross-model analysis and synthesis.

### Purpose

To provide practitioners with proven prompt templates that enable systematic multi-model project assessment, ensuring each AI model operates within its cognitive strengths while producing comparable, actionable outputs.

### Scope

**What's Covered:**

- Strategic assessment prompts for market and vision analysis

**PROJECT**: [Project Name]
**MILESTONE**: [Current Phase/Milestone]
**YOUR ROLE**: DevOps/Engineering Auditor

**CONTEXT**: [Brief technical description and current implementation state]

**YOUR ASSESSMENT FOCUS** (ignore strategic/philosophical aspects):
1. **Implementation Gaps**: What's missing that would prevent adoption?
2. **Tooling Deficiencies**: What automation/validation is needed?
3. **Maintainability Risks**: Where will this break under real-world use?
4. **Deployment Blockers**: What stops someone from using this today?

**DELIVERABLE FORMAT**:
- **Critical Issues**: 3-5 highest-priority problems with specific fixes
- **Missing Tooling**: List with effort estimates (hours/days)
- **Ready-to-Ship Assessment**: Binary yes/no with reasoning
- **Next Sprint Actions**: Concrete tasks with file paths where relevant

**CONSTRAINT**: Focus only on making this work reliably. A different model will handle strategic positioning and methodology questions.

What's your engineering assessment of where this project stands?
