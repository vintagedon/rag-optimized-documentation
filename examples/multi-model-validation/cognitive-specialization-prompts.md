# üéØ **Cognitive Specialization Prompts**

Copy-paste ready prompt templates that leverage each AI model's unique cognitive strengths for systematic multi-perspective project assessment.

---

## **üìñ Introduction**

This document provides tested prompt templates that extract specialized cognitive perspectives from different AI models. Each prompt is designed to leverage specific model strengths while maintaining consistency in output format for cross-model analysis and synthesis.

### Purpose

To provide practitioners with proven prompt templates that enable systematic multi-model project assessment, ensuring each AI model operates within its cognitive strengths while producing comparable, actionable outputs.

### Scope

**What's Covered:**

- Strategic assessment prompts for market and vision analysis
- Technical assessment prompts for implementation and architecture review
- Cross-analysis prompts for model-to-model evaluation
- Output format specifications for consistent comparison

**What's Not Covered:**

- General prompt engineering principles
- Model-specific interface instructions
- Project-specific customization examples

### Target Audience

**Primary Users:** Project managers and engineering leads conducting systematic reviews  
**Secondary Users:** Development teams implementing structured assessment processes  
**Background Assumed:** Basic familiarity with AI model interfaces and project evaluation needs

### Overview

These prompts implement cognitive specialization by assigning specific analytical roles to each model, creating a multi-perspective assessment framework that produces superior decision-making intelligence compared to single-model approaches.
