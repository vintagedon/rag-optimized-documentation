**Repository Preparation:**

For Gemini Analysis:

1. Ensure GitHub repository is public and accessible
2. Copy repository URL for direct import
3. Verify repository reflects current milestone state

For GPT Analysis:

1. Export repository as zip file
2. Remove sensitive files if analyzing private repository
3. Verify zip file size is within upload limits

**Context Gathering:**

Previous Review Integration:

```json
[google_drive_search: "previous milestone reviews project-name"]
[google_drive_search: "strategic concerns phase-previous"]
[google_drive_search: "technical roadmap blockers"]
```

Historical Context Summary:

- Key decisions from previous milestones
- Outstanding issues requiring resolution
- Evolution of project priorities and constraints

**Prompt Template Selection:**

- Strategic Assessment: Select appropriate Gemini strategic prompt template

4. Document tooling deficiencies and fixes
5. Record ready-to-ship assessment and reasoning

**Quality Assurance Checkpoints:**

Strategic Assessment Validation:

- Market analysis includes quantitative sizing
- Competitive positioning addresses specific differentiators
- Adoption thesis connects to user psychology
- Strategic risks are identified with mitigation paths

Technical Assessment Validation:

```

### Phase 3: Cross-Analysis (15 Minutes)

**Cross-Model Validation:**

Strategic ‚Üí Technical Analysis (7 Minutes):

1. Provide GPT's technical assessment to Gemini
2. Request strategic impact analysis of technical constraints
3. Identify where implementation realities affect strategic positioning
4. Document integration recommendations
