## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- **main**: Production-ready releases only
- **develop**: Integration branch for tested features
- **feature/**: Individual feature development
- **docs/**: Documentation-only changes
- **fix/**: Bug fixes and corrections

### Standard Workflow

1. **Create Feature Branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or docs/your-documentation-improvement
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Follow our [Documentation Standards](#documentation-standards)
   - Test changes thoroughly
   - Update related documentation

3. **Commit Changes**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add semantic numbering validation script"
   # Use conventional commit format
   ```

4. **Push and Create Pull Request**

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   # Create pull request through GitHub interface
   ```

### Commit Message Format

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for clear change tracking:

```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: New features or capabilities
- `fix`: Bug fixes and corrections
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Formatting and style improvements
- `refactor`: Code restructuring without feature changes
- `test`: Test additions or improvements
- `chore`: Maintenance and tooling updates

**Examples:**

```
feat: add validation CLI for semantic numbering compliance
docs: improve getting started guide with detailed examples
fix: correct PowerShell parameter handling in creation script
```

## Documentation Standards

### Framework Compliance

All documentation must follow our framework standards:

1. **Semantic Section Numbering**
   - Section 1: Introduction
   - Section 2: Dependencies & Relationships
   - Section 3: [Core Content]
   - Section 4: [Implementation]
   - Section 5: Security & Compliance *(consistent across all documents)*
   - Section 6: Community & Support
   - Section 7: References & Related Resources
   - Section 8: Documentation Metadata

2. **YAML Front Matter**

   ```yaml
   <!--
   ---
   title: "Document Title - Brief Description"
   description: "Actionable description of document purpose"
   author: "Your Name - https://github.com/yourusername"
   ai_contributor: "[AI Model if applicable]"
   date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
   version: "X.Y"
   status: "[Draft/Published]"
   tags:
   - type: [document-type]
   - domain: [subject-area]
   - tech: [technologies]
   - audience: [target-users]
   related_documents:
   - "[Related Doc](_PLACEHOLDER.md)"
   ---
   -->
   ```

3. **Cross-References**
   - Link to related documents systematically
   - Use descriptive link text (not "click here")

   - Include upward navigation to parent directories

### Quality Requirements

- **Clarity**: Write for your target audience's expertise level
