## Problem Statement

**Current Challenge:** Documentation quality management relies on manual review processes that are time-intensive, subjective, and don't scale effectively. Organizations need systematic approaches for automatic quality enforcement, measurement, and improvement tracking that provide specific, actionable guidance for quality enhancement.

**Business Impact from Manual Quality Management:**

- Quality assessment subjectivity: Inconsistent review standards across team members and projects
- Resource intensity: Manual quality checking requiring significant time investment from senior staff
- Scalability limitations: Quality oversight effort increasing linearly with documentation volume
- Issue identification gaps: Manual review missing systematic quality problems

**Current State Assessment (Pre-Automation):**

- Quality measurement: No systematic framework for objective quality assessment
- Issue identification: Ad-hoc discovery of quality problems during usage
- Improvement tracking: No baseline measurements for validating quality enhancement efforts
- Standards enforcement: Subjective compliance checking with variable effectiveness
