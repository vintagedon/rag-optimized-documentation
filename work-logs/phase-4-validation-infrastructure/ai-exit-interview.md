## 🔒 **5. Security & Compliance**

### Access Requirements

Exit interview documentation contains strategic assessment data and competitive intelligence requiring controlled access management and stakeholder confidentiality protocols.

### Security Considerations

**Strategic Information Protection:**

- Competitive advantage analysis requires protection from unauthorized disclosure
- Business intelligence data needs controlled distribution and access management
- Methodology insights may contain proprietary collaboration approaches requiring confidentiality

**Validation Infrastructure Security:**

- Zero external dependencies eliminate supply chain vulnerabilities and security risks
- Read-only repository analysis prevents data modification and maintains audit integrity
- Local processing ensures enterprise data privacy and regulatory compliance requirements

### File Permissions

Exit interview documentation should maintain executive access controls while supporting organizational learning and framework improvement transparency requirements.

### Compliance Notes

Exit interview analysis supports enterprise governance through comprehensive outcome documentation, regulatory compliance through systematic quality measurement audit trails, and intellectual property protection through proper methodology attribution and usage guidelines.

## 🛠️ **6. Maintenance & Support**

### File Management

**Adding Retrospective Insights:**
Incorporate additional phase evaluation data and lessons learned following established retrospective documentation standards and outcome measurement protocols.

**Modifying Assessment Criteria:**
Update evaluation frameworks based on organizational learning requirements while maintaining historical comparison capabilities and outcome tracking consistency.

**Dependencies:**
Exit interview updates required when validation infrastructure undergoes significant evolution or competitive landscape analysis requires strategic assessment modification.

### Testing

Exit interview documentation requires validation through stakeholder review and competitive intelligence verification processes.

```bash
# Validate exit interview compliance
python ../../src/analyze_docs.py . --include="ai-exit-interview.md"

# Cross-reference outcome achievements
grep -A10 -B5 "ROI\|business\|competitive" *.md | sort | uniq
```

### Common Issues
