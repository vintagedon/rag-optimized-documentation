## Lessons Learned & Knowledge Capture

### What Worked Exceptionally Well

1. **Unconscious TRACE Application:** Methodology internalization enabled natural structured approach without explicit framework invocation
2. **ChatGPT Thinking Mode:** Multi-minute deliberation periods prevented errors and improved solution quality significantly
3. **Laser Surgery Iteration:** Small, focused changes with full discussion outperformed large architectural modifications

### What Could Have Been Done Better

1. **Explicit Methodology Documentation:** More systematic recording of TRACE cycle application for research purposes
2. **Broader Testing:** Additional repository types and edge cases for validation robustness
3. **Performance Benchmarking:** Quantified performance metrics for scalability assessment

### Technical Insights

- **Algorithm Selection:** Regex-based parsing provides sufficient accuracy for validation with better performance than AST approaches
- **Error Handling Strategy:** Graceful degradation enables partial results rather than complete failure on edge cases
- **Output Format Design:** Multiple formats (JSON/CSV/Markdown) serve different automation and human consumption needs

### Business Engagement Insights

- **Value Demonstration:** Immediate repository analysis provides compelling evidence of framework value
- **Adoption Barriers:** Zero external dependencies critical for enterprise security requirements
- **Competitive Differentiation:** Automated semantic validation creates defensible market position

### Process Improvements for Future Projects

1. **Systematic TRACE Documentation:** Explicit recording of methodology application for research and training purposes
