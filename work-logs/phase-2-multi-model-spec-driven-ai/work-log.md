**Request:** Create detailed Docker Flask specification with acceptance criteria  
**Analyze:** AI analyzed requirements and proposed comprehensive specification structure  
**Verify:** Approved specification format including objective, constraints, and executable tests  

### Cycle 2: Multi-Model Testing (G-V2-R)

**Generate:** Delivered identical specification to three AI models  
**Validate:** Confirmed all implementations met acceptance criteria  
**Reflect:** Identified quality patterns and consistency insights  

### Cycle 3: Documentation Framework (A-V1-G)

**Analyze:** AI proposed comprehensive documentation structure  
**Verify:** Approved 16-file documentation suite approach  
**Generate:** Created complete documentation with semantic numbering  

### Cycles 4-8: Content Development

**Iterative RAVGVR cycles for:**

- Small project README and examples
- Multi-model test documentation
- Cross-consistency analysis
- Framework implementation guides
- Template applications
